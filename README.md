# Parallel-computation-designs-using-systolic-arrays-in-VHDL
Designed and implemented systolic array architectures that do parallel computation through processing elements (PE's). They were part of assignments for Advanced Digital Designs course (EE119B) at Caltech.

**Conway's Game of Life**

●	Designed and implemented a cellular automaton which consists of processing element cells in two-dimensional mesh.

**GCD Processor**

●	Designed a systolic array for computing the GCD of two unsigned numbers, which can compute the results in one clock through pipelined PE cells (PE: Processing Element)
