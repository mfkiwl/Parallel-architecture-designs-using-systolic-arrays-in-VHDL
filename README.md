# Parallel-computation-designs-using-systolic-arrays-in-VHDL
Digital designs that do parallel computation through by utilizing processing elements (PE's). They are part of assignments for Advanced Digital Designs course (EE119B) at Caltech.

●	Designed a systolic array for computing the GCD of two unsigned numbers, which can compute the results in one clock through pipelined PE cells (PE: Processing Element)

●	Designed and implemented a cellular automaton which consists of processing element cells in two-dimensional mesh.
